# API

A simple API that uses express to handle different _http requests. 

This is for the projects of the Campus Street Boot Camp, given as a class activity.

## How to Run

Please check that you have Node.js installed with npm. If you don't know where to start, check https://nodejs.org/.

Then run what a usual Node.js application needs with dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Finally, run our application:

```shell
npm start # works the same for: node index.js
```


## Requirement

Please do not forget to include the data.json file in the same folder.
